class ImplicitRenderer(torch.nn.Module):
    """
    A class for rendering a batch of implicit surfaces. The class should
    be initialized with a raysampler and raymarcher class which both have
    to be a `Callable`.

    VOLUMETRIC_FUNCTION

    The `forward` function of the renderer accepts as input the rendering cameras
    as well as the `volumetric_function` `Callable`, which defines a field of opacity
    and feature vectors over the 3D domain of the scene.

    A standard `volumetric_function` has the following signature:
    ```
    def volumetric_function(
        ray_bundle: RayBundle,
        **kwargs,
    ) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]
    ```
    With the following arguments:
        `ray_bundle`: A RayBundle object containing the following variables:
            `origins`: A tensor of shape `(minibatch, ..., 3)` denoting
                the origins of the rendering rays.
            `directions`: A tensor of shape `(minibatch, ..., 3)`
                containing the direction vectors of rendering rays.
            `lengths`: A tensor of shape
                `(minibatch, ..., num_points_per_ray)`containing the
                lengths at which the ray points are sampled.
            `xys`: A tensor of shape
                `(minibatch, ..., 2)` containing the
                xy locations of each ray's pixel in the screen space.
    Calling `volumetric_function` then returns the following:
        `rays_densities`: A tensor of shape
            `(minibatch, ..., num_points_per_ray, opacity_dim)` containing
            the an opacity vector for each ray point.
        `rays_features`: A tensor of shape
            `(minibatch, ..., num_points_per_ray, feature_dim)` containing
            the an feature vector for each ray point.

    Note that, in order to increase flexibility of the API, we allow multiple
    other arguments to enter the volumetric function via additional
    (optional) keyword arguments `**kwargs`.
    A typical use-case is passing a `CamerasBase` object as an additional
    keyword argument, which can allow the volumetric function to adjust its
    outputs based on the directions of the projection rays.

    Example:
        A simple volumetric function of a 0-centered
        RGB sphere with a unit diameter is defined as follows:
        ```
        def volumetric_function(
            ray_bundle: RayBundle,
            **kwargs,
        ) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:

            # first convert the ray origins, directions and lengths
            # to 3D ray point locations in world coords
            rays_points_world = ray_bundle_to_ray_points(ray_bundle)

            # set the densities as an inverse sigmoid of the
            # ray point distance from the sphere centroid
            rays_densities = torch.sigmoid(
                -100.0 * rays_points_world.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
            )

            # set the ray features to RGB colors proportional
            # to the 3D location of the projection of ray points
            # on the sphere surface
            rays_features = torch.nn.functional.normalize(
                rays_points_world, dim=-1
            ) * 0.5 + 0.5

            return rays_densities, rays_features
        ```
