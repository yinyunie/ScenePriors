            pixel_coords_cameras: (N, H, W, K, 3) tensor of pixel coordinates in the

                is considered "background" if no mesh triangle projects to it. This is

        # Our implementation has 6 stages. In the description below, we will call each
        # pixel q and the 9 surrounding splatting pixels (including itself) p.
        #     1. Use barycentrics to compute the position of each pixel in screen
        # coordinates. These should exactly correspond to pixel centers during the
        # forward pass, but can be shifted on backwards. This step allows gradients to
        # travel to vertex coordinates, even if the rasterizer is non-differentiable.
        #     2a. For each center pixel q, take each splatting p and decide whether it
        # is on the same surface level as q, or in the background or foreground.
        #     2b. For each center pixel q, compute the splatting weight of surrounding
        # pixels p, and their splatting colors (which are just the original colors
        # weighted by the splatting weights).
        #     3. As a vectorization technicality, offset the tensors corresponding to
        # the splatting p values in the nine directions, by padding each of nine
        # splatting layers on the bottom/top, left/right.
        #     4. Do the actual splatting, by accumulating the splatting colors of the
        # surrounding p's for each pixel q. The weights get accumulated separately for
        # p's that got assigned to the background/surface/foreground in Step 2a.

        # compose the resulting color maps.
