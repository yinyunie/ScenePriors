    """
    Converts a batch of OpenCV-conventioned cameras parametrized with the
    rotation matrices `R`, translation vectors `tvec`, and the camera
    calibration matrices `camera_matrix` to `PerspectiveCameras` in PyTorch3D
    convention.

    More specifically, the conversion is carried out such that a projection
    of a 3D shape to the OpenCV-conventioned screen of size `image_size` results
    in the same image as a projection with the corresponding PyTorch3D camera
    to the NDC screen convention of PyTorch3D.

    More specifically, the OpenCV convention projects points to the OpenCV screen
    space as follows:
        ```
        x_screen_opencv = camera_matrix @ (R @ x_world + tvec)
        ```
    followed by the homogenization of `x_screen_opencv`.

    Note:
        The parameters `R, tvec, camera_matrix` correspond to the outputs of
        `cv2.decomposeProjectionMatrix`.

        The `rvec` parameter of the `cv2.projectPoints` is an axis-angle vector
        that can be converted to the rotation matrix `R` expected here by
        calling the `so3_exp_map` function.

    Args:
        R: A batch of rotation matrices of shape `(N, 3, 3)`.
        tvec: A batch of translation vectors of shape `(N, 3)`.
        camera_matrix: A batch of camera calibration matrices of shape `(N, 3, 3)`.
        image_size: A tensor of shape `(N, 2)` containing the sizes of the images
            (height, width) attached to each camera.

    Returns:
        cameras_pytorch3d: A batch of `N` cameras in the PyTorch3D convention.
