    "# Fit a simple Neural Radiance Field via raymarching\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to fit Neural Radiance Field given a set of views of a scene using differentiable implicit function rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, this tutorial will explain how to:\n",
    "1. Create a differentiable implicit function renderer with either image-grid or Monte Carlo ray sampling.\n",
    "2. Create an Implicit model of a scene.\n",
    "3. Fit the implicit function (Neural Radiance Field) based on input images using the differentiable implicit renderer. \n",
    "4. Visualize the learnt implicit function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the presented implicit model is a simplified version of NeRF:<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "The simplifications include:\n",
    "* *Ray sampling*: This notebook does not perform stratified ray sampling but rather ray sampling at equidistant depths.\n",
    "* *Rendering*: We do a single rendering pass, as opposed to the original implementation that does a coarse and fine rendering pass.\n",
    "* *Architecture*: Our network is shallower which allows for faster optimization possibly at the cost of surface details.\n",
    "* *Mask loss*: Since our observations include segmentation masks, we also optimize a silhouette loss that forces rays to either get fully absorbed inside the volume, or to completely pass through it.\n"

The harmonic embeddings then enter the _color_ and _opacity_ branches of the NeRF model in order to label each ray point with a 3D vector and a 1D scalar ranging in [0-1] which define the point's RGB color and opacity respectively.\n",
